A VPC with EC2 with custom kubernetes installed and set.
and ever deployment is docrized and pushed to docker and 
then deployed into the already set up k8s cluster with 3
replicas and rolling deployment. I is only a staic angular page

- infrastructure is created using cloudformation scripts
 which are in the folder /aws
- few steps in   Kubernetes cluster initialization were done 
manually as this was first attemp at setting up and needed debugging (not a repetative task anyway)
